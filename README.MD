1. a). Constant Time O(1) because it has no iterations it will take the
       same amount of time every time.
   b). Linear Time O(n) b/c time is exactly proportional to input size

2. Constant Time 0(1) b/c no matter what size the input is, it will 
   only run one time.

3. Polynomial Time 0(n^2) b/c it has to loop through all input twice due
   to nested for loops

4. Linear Time O(n) b/c it runs a single loop on the array exactly          proportional to input size

5. Linear Time O(n) b/c it runs a single loop on the array exactly          proportional to input size. Theres is only one loop.

6. Polynomial Time 0(n^2) b/c it has to loop through all input twice due
   to nested for loops

7. The algorithm returns the Fibonacci number, it has a Linear Time O(n)    complexity.

8. Logarithmic Time O(Log(n)) b/c it halves the data every iteration        until it finds the correct index.

9. Constant Time O(1) because it does not iterate over data

10. Linear time O(n) b/c as n gets bigger the number of iterations           increases proportionally.

11. 1). from Rod A take small disk place on Rod C
    2). from Rod A take med disk place on Rod B
    3). from Rod C take small disk place on Rod B
    4). from Rod A take large disk and place on Rod C
    5). from Rod B take small disk and place on Rod A
    6). from Rod B take med disk and place on Rod C
    7). from Rod A take small disk and place on Rod C

    disk1 to rodC, disk2 to rodB, disc1 on rodC to rodB, disc 3 on rodA to rodC, disc1 on rodB to rodA, 

    func hanoi(disks, rodA, rodB, rodC){
      if(rodC.length === disks){
        return
      }
