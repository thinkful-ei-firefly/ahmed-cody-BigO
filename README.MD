1. a). Constant Time O(1) because it has no iterations it will take the
       same amount of time every time.
   b). Linear Time O(n) b/c time is exactly proportional to input size

2. Constant Time 0(1) b/c no matter what size the input is, it will 
   only run one time.

3. Polynomial Time 0(n^2) b/c it has to loop through all input twice due
   to nested for loops

4. Linear Time O(n) b/c it runs a single loop on the array exactly          proportional to input size

5. Linear Time O(n) b/c it runs a single loop on the array exactly          proportional to input size. Theres is only one loop.

6. Polynomial Time 0(n^2) b/c it has to loop through all input twice due
   to nested for loops

7. The algorithm returns the Fibonacci number, it has a Linear Time O(n)    complexity.

8. Logarithmic Time O(Log(n)) b/c it halves the data every iteration        until it finds the correct index.

9. Constant Time O(1) because it does not iterate over data

10. Linear time O(n) b/c as n gets bigger the number of iterations           increases proportionally.

11.  - For 4 Disk algorithm 
    Disk 1 A->B
    Disk 2 A->C
    Disk 1 B->C
    Disk 3 A->B
    Disk 1 C->A
    Disk 2 C->B
    Disk 1 A->B
    Disk 4 A->C
    Disk 1 B->C
    Disk 2 B->A
    Disk 1 C->A
    Disk 3 B->C
    Disk 1 A->B
    Disk 2 A->C
    Disk 1 B->C

     - If we have 5 disk then after 7 recursive calls rod A will have 5 disk and rod B will have 1 disk and rod C will have 1 disk.
